	<p>
	Dear Mr. Marquez,
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My name is Terrence Ricardo John, a Computer Operator II assigned to Operations Section of the Information Systems (IS) Department of the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission. I am writing to submit my application for the advertised position of Software Developer II within the Software Services Section of the IS Department. Based on the job description and requirements, I would like to express my enthused interest, being strongly confident of both my high suitability and qualification for this role.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	With a career spanning seventeen (17) years at the Commission, and with ten (10) of those years dedicated to the Operations Section of the IS Department, Software Services will be familiar territory to me: both sections are technical fields that require high standards of professionalism, leadership, communication, technical prowess, and minimal room for error. These are strong qualities that have been learned and cultivated during my long tenure of employment; the veracity of this statement can be ascertained from not only excellent Performance Appraisal scores on an annual basis, but also from the fact that I have been consistently entrusted by my superiors to act advanced-level grades involving critical functions. These factual records are a testament to my capability of sustaining optimum performance levels and high reliability on a daily basis over years of time.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In conjunction with the courses that were covered in my BSc Information Technology degree at the University of the West Indies, and the Microsoft Training Courses provided by the Commission, quality personal time has been dedicated towards Independent Learning: a key to success in both my university years and personal life. Driven to expand my skillset and marketability during post-graduation, I subscribed to online training courses, becoming actively engaged in coding and building projects with the C# Programming Language and the .NET Development Framework: two highly demanded skills in the IT World. Seeing that exposure to the .NET Framework is a prerequisite for the position, I was strongly compelled to apply. With a broad knowledge base from multiple sources, my knowledge and perspective of Software Development has greatly expanded to newer levels of versatility. Proof of this newfound versatility is demonstrated from <i>the fact that the very Cover Letter and Résumé submitted were both coded from purely HTML and CSS for greater control and flexibility</i>. Nothing was written in Microsoft Word, and the source code can be found in my GitHub repository, along with other projects.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	High versatility can further be displayed during deployment to the Technical & End User Support section of the Information Systems Department for training and skill-building. While there, I was able to rapidly learn and apply new knowledge, eventually becoming a high-value team member capable of determining problem causes, and providing consistent and effectively implemented solutions. While training enhanced my innate ability to problem-solve, it also allowed me to form good rapport with other members of the IS sections and beyond. I eventually became recognized throughout the Commission for my impeccable work standards and problem-solving skills, and sought after to assist in numerous user issues; I have even assisted members of the Software Services team with resolving technical problems on multiple occasions. Becoming a Software Developer places me in a strategic position to have overarching exposure and experience in Operations, Technical Support, <i>and</i> Software Services: a powerful development that can aid in driving the IS Department forward.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I hope my résumé convinces you of my ability to continue performing with excellence in a higher capacity as a Software Developer II, giving consideration to the fact that not only do I possess the technical expertise but also the character to assume the role.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I sincerely thank you in advance for considering my application. I look forward to hearing your feedback.
	</p>
